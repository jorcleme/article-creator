A regular expression is a pattern (a phrase, number, or more complex pattern). The CLI String Search feature matches regular expressions to the show or more command output. Regular expressions are case-sensitive and allow for complex matching requirements. A regular expression can be a single-character pattern or a multiple-character pattern. That is, a regular expression can be a single character that matches the same single character in the command output or multiple characters that match the same multiple characters in the command output. The pattern in the command output is referred to as a string. This section describes creating both single-character patterns and multiple-character patterns. It also discusses creating more complex regular expressions, using multipliers, alternation, anchoring, and parentheses.",
            "Single-Character Patterns The simplest regular expression is a single character that matches the same single character in the command output. You can use any letter (A-Z, a-z) or digit (0-9) as a single-character pattern. You can also use other keyboard characters (such as ! or ~) as single-character patterns, but certain keyboard characters have special meaning when used in regular expressions. The following table lists the keyboard characters that have special meanings Character Meaning . Matches any single character, including white space. * Matches 0 or more sequences of the pattern. + Matches 1 or more sequences of the pattern. ? Matches 0 or 1 occurrences of the pattern. ^ Matches the beginning of the string. $ Matches the end of the string. To use these special characters as single-character patterns, remove the special meaning by preceding each character with a backslash (). The following examples are single-character patterns matching a dollar sign, an underscore, and a plus sign, respectively. $ _ + You can specify a range of single-character patterns to match against command output. For example, you can create a regular expression that matches a string containing one of the following letters: a, e, i, o, or u. Only one of these characters must exist in the string for pattern matching to succeed. To specify a range of single-character patterns, enclose the single-character patterns in square brackets ([ ]). For example, [aeiou] matches any one of the five vowels of the lowercase alphabet, while [abcdABCD] matches any one of the first four letters of the lower- or uppercase alphabet. You can simplify ranges by entering only the endpoints of the range separated by a dash (-). Simplify the previous range as follows: [a-dA-D] To add a dash as a single-character pattern in your range, include another dash and precede it with a backslash: [a-dA-D-] You can also include a right square bracket (]) as a single-character pattern in your range, as shown here: [a-dA-D-] The previous example matches any one of the first four letters of the lower- or uppercase alphabet, a dash, or a right square bracket. You can reverse the matching of the range by including a caret (^) at the start of the range. The following example matches any letter except the ones listed: [^a-dqsv] The following example matches anything except a right square bracket (]) or the letter d: [^]d]",
            "Multiple-Character Patterns When creating regular expressions, you can also specify a pattern containing multiple characters. You create multiple-character regular expressions by joining letters, digits, or keyboard characters that do not have special meaning. For example, a4% is a multiple-character regular expression. With multiple-character patterns, order is important. The regular expression a4% matches the character a followed by a 4 followed by a % sign. If the string does not have a4%, in that order, pattern matching fails. The multiple-character regular expression a. uses the special meaning of the period character to match the letter a followed by any single character. With this example, the strings ab, a!, or a2 are all valid matches for the regular expression. You can remove the special meaning of the period character by inserting a backslash before it. For example, when the expression a. is used in the command syntax, only the string a. will be matched. You can create a multiple-character regular expression containing all letters, all digits, all keyboard characters, or a combination of letters, digits, and other keyboard characters. For example, telebit 3107 v32bis is a valid regular expression.",
            "Multipliers You can create more complex regular expressions that instruct the system to match multiple occurrences of a specified regular expression. To do so, use some special characters with your single-character and multiple-character patterns. Table 1 lists the special characters that specify multiples of a regular expression. Table 1. Table 1: Special Characters Used as Multipliers Character Description * Matches 0 or more single-character or multiple-character patterns. + Matches 1 or more single-character or multiple-character patterns. ? Matches 0 or 1 occurrences of a single-character or multiple-character pattern. The following example matches any number of occurrences of the letter a, including none: a* The following pattern requires that at least one letter a be in the string to be matched: a+ The following pattern matches the string bb or bab: ba?b The following string matches any number of asterisks (*): * To use multipliers with multiple-character patterns, enclose the pattern in parentheses. In the following example, the pattern matches any number of the multiple-character string ab: (ab)* The following pattern matches one or more instances of alphanumeric pairs, but not none (that is, an empty string is not a match): ([A-Za-z][0-9])+ The order for matches using multipliers (*, +, or ?) is to put the longest construct first. Nested constructs are matched from outside to inside. Concatenated constructs are matched beginning at the left side of the construct. Thus, the regular expression above matches A9b3, but not 9Ab3 because the letters are specified before the numbers.",
            "Alternation Alternation allows you to specify alternative patterns to match against a string. You separate the alternative patterns with a vertical bar (|). Only one of the alternatives can match the string. For example, the regular expression codex|telebit either matches the string codex or the string telebit, but not both codex and telebit.",
            "Anchoring You can instruct the system to match a regular expression pattern against the beginning or the end of the string. You anchor these regular expressions to a portion of the string using the special characters shown in Table 2. Table 2. Table 2: Special Characters Used for Anchoring Character Description ^ Matches the beginning of the string. $ Matches the end of the string. For example, the regular expression ^con matches any string that starts with con, and $sole matches any string that ends with sole. In addition to indicating the beginning of a string, the ^ symbol can be used to indicate the logical function not when used in a bracketed range. For example, the expression [^abcd] indicates a range that matches any single letter, as long as it is not the letters a, b, c, or d."

In this mode, only a single host can be authorized on the port. When a port is unauthorized and the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the guest VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. If guest VLAN is not enabled on the port, only tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from the authorized host is bridged based on the static vlan membership configured at the port. Traffic from other hosts is dropped. A user can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized host will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. In this case, tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the RADIUS-assigned VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. The switch removes from FDB all MAC addresses learned on a port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. Multi-Host Mode The multi-host mode manages the authentication status of the port: the port is authorized after at least one host is authorized. When a port is unauthorized and the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged traffic is remapped to the guest VLAN. Tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the guest VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. If guest VLAN is not enabled on the port, only tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged. When a port is authorized, untagged and tagged traffic from all hosts connected to the port is bridged based on the static vlan membership configured at the port. A user can specify that untagged traffic from the authorized port will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. In this case, tagged traffic is dropped unless the VLAN tag is the RADIUS assigned VLAN or the unauthenticated VLANs. The switch removes from FDB all MAC addresses learned on a port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. Multi-Sessions Mode Unlike the single-host and multi-host modes (port-based modes) the multi-sessions mode manages the authentication status for each host connected to the port (session-based mode). If the multi-sessions mode is configured on a port the port does have any authentication status. Any number of hosts can be authorized on the port. The command can limit the maximum number of authorized hosts allowed on the port. Each authorized client requires a TCAM rule. If there is no available space in the TCAM, the authentication is rejected. When using the dot1x host-mode command to change the port mode to single-host or multi-host when authentication is enabled, the port state is set to unauthorized. If the dot1x host-mode command changes the port mode to multi-session when authentication is enabled, the state of all attached hosts is set to unauthorized. To change the port mode to single-host or multi-host, set the port (dot1x port-control) to force-unauthorized, change the port mode to single-host or multi-host, and set the port to authorization auto. multi-sessions mode cannot be configured on the same interface together with Policy Based VLANs configured by the following commands: switchport general map protocol-group vlans switchport general map macs-group vlans Tagged traffic belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is always bridged regardless if a host is authorized or not. When the guest VLAN is enabled, untagged and tagged traffic from unauthorized hosts not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs is bridged via the guest VLAN. Traffic from an authorized hosts is bridged in accordance with the port static configuration. A user can specify that untagged and tagged traffic from the authorized host not belonging to the unauthenticated VLANs will be remapped to a VLAN that is assigned by a RADIUS server during the authentication process. The switch does not remove from FDB the host MAC address learned on the port when its authentication status is changed from authorized to unauthorized. The MAC address will be removed after the aging timeout expires. 802.1x enabled on a port associated with a port channel has the following limitations: Only the 802.1X-based authentication is supported.

(The former two match conditions allow for ICMPv6 neighbor discovery.) The IPv6 neighbor discovery process uses the IPv6 network layer service, therefore, by default, IPv6 ACLs implicitly allow IPv6 neighbor discovery packets to be sent and received on an interface. In IPv4, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which is equivalent to the IPv6 neighbor discovery process, uses a separate data link layer protocol; therefore, by default, IPv4 ACLs implicitly allow ARP packets to be sent and received on an interface.",

In this case, the switch will resume sending General Query messages if it does hear another Querier for Query Passive interval that equals to <Robustness>*<Query Interval> + 0.5*<Query Response Interval).

Each outgoing packet can result in one or two error messages. A \"time exceeded\u201d error message indicates that an intermediate router has seen and discarded the probe. A \"destination unreachable\" error message indicates that the destination node has received the probe and discarded it because it could not deliver the packet.

Duplicate address detection uses neighbor solicitation messages to verify the uniqueness of Unicast IPv6 addresses. The DupAddrDetectTransmits node configuration variable (as specified in RFC 4862, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) is used to automatically determine the number of consecutive neighbor solicitation messages that are sent on an interface, while duplicate address detection is performed on a tentative Unicast IPv6 address. The interval between duplicate address detection, neighbor solicitation messages (the duplicate address detection timeout interval) is specified by the neighbor discovery-related variable RetransTimer (as specified in RFC 4861, Neighbor Discovery for IPv6), which is used to determine the time between retransmissions of neighbor solicitation messages to a neighbor when resolving the address or when probing the reachability of a neighbor. This is the same management variable used to specify the interval for neighbor solicitation messages during address resolution and neighbor unreachability detection. Duplicate address detection is suspended on interfaces that are administratively down. While an interface is administratively down, the Unicast IPv6 addresses assigned to the interface are set to a pending state. Duplicate address detection is automatically restarted on an interface when the interface returns to being administratively up. An interface returning to administratively up, restarts duplicate address detection for all of the Unicast IPv6 addresses on the interface. While duplicate address detection is performed on the link-local address of an interface, the state for the other IPv6 addresses is still set to TENTATIVE. When duplicate address detection is completed on the link-local address, duplicate address detection is performed on the remaining IPv6 addresses. When duplicate address detection identifies a duplicate address, the state of the address is set to DUPLICATE and the address is not used. If the duplicate address is the link-local address of the interface, the processing of IPv6 packets is disabled on the interface and an error SYSLOG message is issued. If the duplicate address is a global address of the interface, the address is not used and an error SYSLOG message is issued. All configuration commands associated with the duplicate address remain as configured while the state of the address is set to DUPLICATE. If the link-local address for an interface changes, duplicate address detection is performed on the new link-local address and all of the other IPv6 address associated with the interface are regenerated (duplicate address detection is performed only on the new link-local address). Note. Since DAD is not supported on NBMA interfaces the command is allowed but does not impact on an IPv6 tunnel interface of the ISATAP type it does not impact. The configuration is saved and will impacted when the interface type is changed on another type on which DAD is supported (for example, to the IPv6 manual tunnel).",

For example, if the last configured sequence number is 43, the new entry will have the sequence number of 48. If the list is empty, the first prefix-list entry is assigned the number 5 and subsequent prefix list entries increment by 5. This command with the seq keyword puts the new entry into the place specified by the parameter, if an entry with the number exists it is replaced by the new one. This command without the seq keyword removes the prefix list. The no version of this command with the seq keyword removes the specified entry. The sequence number of a prefix list entry determines the order of the entries in the list. The router compares network addresses to the prefix list entries. The router begins the comparison at the top of the prefix list, with the entry having the lowest sequence number. If multiple entries of a prefix list match a prefix, the entry with the lowest sequence number is considered the real match. Once a match or deny occurs, the router does not go through the rest of the prefix list. For efficiency, you might want to put the most common permits or denies near the top of the list, using the seq-number argument. IPv6 prefix lists are used to specify certain prefixes or a range of prefixes that must be matched before a permit or deny statement can be applied. Two operand keywords can be used to designate a range of prefix lengths to be matched. A prefix length of less than, or equal to, a value is configured with the le keyword. A prefix length greater than, or equal to, a value is specified using the ge keyword. The ge and le keywords can be used to specify the range of the prefix length to be matched in more detail than the usual ipv6-prefix/prefix-length argument. For a candidate prefix to match against a prefix list entry the following conditions must exist: The candidate prefix must match the specified prefix list and prefix length entry The value of the optional le keyword specifies the range of allowed prefix lengths from 0 up to the value of the le-length argument, and including, this value. The value of the optional ge keyword specifies the range of allowed prefix lengths from the value of the ge-length argument up to, and including, 128. Note that the first condition must match before the other conditions take effect. An exact match is assumed when the ge or le keywords are not specified. If only one keyword operand is specified then the condition for that keyword is applied, and the other condition is not applied. The prefix-length value must be less than the ge value. The ge value must be less than, or equal to, the le value. The le value must be less than or equal to 128. Every IPv6 prefix list, including prefix lists that do not have permit and deny condition statements, has an implicit deny any any statement as its last match condition. Formal Specification Checked prefix is cP and checked prefix length is cL. Function PrefixIsEqual(P1, P2, L) compares the first L bits of two addresses P1 and P2 and returns TRUE if they are equal. Case 1. A prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is not defined le - is not defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL = L Case 2. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is defined le - is not defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL >= ge Case 3. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is not defined le - is defined The prefix cP/cL matches to the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & cL <= le Case 4. An prefix-list entry is: P - prefix address L - prefix length ge - is defined le - is defined The prefix cP/cL matches the prefix-list entry if PrefixIsEqual(cP,P,L) & ge <= cL <= le",

Keywords Macros may contain keywords (parameters). The following describes these keywords: A macro can contain up to three keywords. All matching occurrences of the keyword are replaced by the corresponding value specified in the macro command. Keyword matching is case-sensitive Applying a macro with keywords does not change the state of the original macro definition. User Feedback The behavior of a macro command requiring user feedback is the same as if the command is entered from terminal: it sends its prompt to the terminal and accepts the user reply. Creating a Macro Use the following guidelines to create a macro: Use macro name to create the macro with the specified name. Enter one macro command per line. Use the @ character to end the macro. Use the   character at the beginning of a line to enter a comment in the macro. In addition,   is used to identify certain preprocessor commands that can only be used within a macro. There are two possible preprocessor commands:  macro key description - Each macro can be configured with up to 3 keyword/description pairs. The keywords and descriptions are displayed in the GUI pages when the macro is displayed. The syntax for this preprocessor command is as follows:  macro key description $keyword1 description1 $keyword2 description2 $keyword3 description3 A keyword must be prefixed with '$'.  macro keywords - This instruction enables the device to display the keywords as part of the CLI help. It accepts up to 3 keywords. The command creates a CLI help string with the keywords for the macro. The help string will be displayed if help on the macro is requested from the macro and macro global commands. The GUI also uses the keywords specified in the command as the parameter names for the macro. See Example 2 and 3 below for a description of how this command is used in the CLI. The syntax for this preprocessor command is as follows:  macro keywords $keyword1 $keyword2 $keyword3 where $keywordn is the name of the keyword. Editing a Macro Macros cannot be edited. Modify a macro by creating a new macro with the same name as the existing macro. The newer macro overwrites the existing macro. The exceptions to this are the built-in macros and corresponding anti-macros for the Smartport feature. You cannot override a Smartport macro. Scope of Macro It is important to consider the scope of any user-defined macro. Because of the potential hazards of applying unintended configurations, do not change configuration modes within the macro by using commands such as exit, end, or interface interface-id. With a few exceptions, there are other ways of executing macros in the various configuration modes. Macros may be executed in Privileged Exec mode, Global Configuration mode, and Interface Configuration mode (when the interface is NOT a VLAN.)",

When you run a macro, if a line in it fails because of a syntax or configuration error, the macro continues to apply the remaining commands to the interface. If you apply a macro that contains parameters in its commands, the command fails if you do not provide the values for the parameters. You can use the macro apply macro-name with a '?' to display the help string for the macro keywords (if you have defined these with the  macro keywords preprocessor command). Parameter (keyword) matching is case sensitive. All matching occurrences of the parameter are replaced with the provided value. Any full match of a keyword, even if it is part of a large string, is considered a match and replaced by the corresponding value. When you apply a macro to an interface, the switch automatically generates a macro description command with the macro name. As a result, the macro name is appended to the macro history of the interface. The show parser macro command displays the macro history of an interface. A macro applied to an interface range behaves the same way as a macro applied to a single interface. When a macro is applied to an interface range, it is applied sequentially to each interface within the range. If a macro command fails on one interface, it is nonetheless attempted to be applied and may fail or succeed on the remaining interfaces.",

If MLD Querier election mechanism is disabled, MLD Snooping Querier delays sending General Query messages for 60 seconds from the time it was enabled. During this time, if the switch did not receive an IGMP query from another Querier - it starts sending General Query messages. Once the switch acts as a Querier, it will stop sending General Query messages if it detects another Querier on the VLAN. In this case, the switch will resume sending General Query messages if it does hear another Querier for Query Passive interval that equals to <Robustness>*<Query Interval> + 0.5*<Query Response Interval). It is recommended to disable MLD Querier election mechanism if there is an IPMv6 Multicast router on the VLAN.",

The classification is by first match, therefore, the order of the ACLs is important.

Use this command to specify whether the port is trusted and which fields of the packet to use to classify traffic. When the system is configured with trust DSCP, the traffic is mapped to the queue by the DSCP-queue map. When the system is configured with trust CoS, the traffic is mapped to the queue by the CoS-queue map.

If the port mode is changed to access and the access VLAN does not exist, then the port does not belong to any VLAN. Use the switchport mode vlan-mapping {tunnel | one-to-one} command to configure a VLAN mapping mode of an edge interface of a Provider Edge switch. The edge interface is an interface where a Customer network is connected to the Provider Edge switch. The network which the switch belongs to is a Provider network. These networks (Customer ones and Provider one) can use the same VLAN-IDs and the edge interface must perform vlan mapping between Customer VLANs (C-VLANs) and Provider VLANs (S-VLANs). On an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN tags are kept as part of payload. When a frame is sent on non-edge tagged interface, it is encapsulated with another layer of S-VLAN tag to which the original C-VLAN-ID is mapped. Therefore, transmitted on non-edge interfaces frames are double-tagged, with the outer S-VLAN tag and inner C-VLAN tag. When a frame is sent on an edge interface the S-VLAN tag is stripped. On an edge interface C-VLANs are mapped to the S-VLANs and the original C-VLAN-ID in input frame is replaced by the S-VLAN ID to which it is mapped. Untagged frames are dropped. Symmetrical translating back to the edge interface. The following features cannot be enabled if vlan-mapping is allowed: IPv4 routing IPv6 routing Auto Smart Port Voice VLAN The switchport vlan-mapping commands cannot add a port to a S-VLAN. IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces cannot be defined on VLANs containing edge interfaces. The following Layer 2 features are not supported into VLANs containing edge interfaces: IGMP Snooping MLD Snooping DHCP Snooping IPv6 First Hop Security The following protocols cannot be enabled on edge interfaces: STP GVRP The following features are not supported on edge interfaces: Radius VLAN assignment 802.1x Guest VLAN Egress ACLs are not supported on one-to-one VLAN mapping edge ports. A destination port with the network keyword or reflector port cannot be configured on an edge port. Note. All the limitations for edge ports specified above are checked by the switchport vlan-mapping commands and by the commands configuring these features. By default the switch does not forward frames received on edge ports with the following destination MAC addresses: 01:80:C2:00:00:00-01:80:C2:00:00:FF 01:00:0C:00:00:00-01:00:0C:FF:FF:FF 01:00:0C:CD:CD:D0 Note.

Adds to the ACL one rule for each VLAN from vlan-list. Reserves the place into TTI for this ACL. If there is not enough free place into TTI the command fails. Note. The ACL can be bound on the interface later by the vlan-mapping tunnel command. Adds the edge interface to the VLAN specified by the outer-vlan-id argument. The ACL contains V+1 rules, where: V\u2014The number of specified C-VLANs. A few switchport vlan-mapping tunnel commands can be defined on the same interface, only if their vlan-list arguments do not contain common VLAN-IDs. Use the no switchport vlan-mapping tunnel vlan-list command to delete tunneling for the specified C-VLANs and remove the interface from the corresponding S-VLANs. Use the no switchport vlan-mapping tunnel default command to delete the default tunneling and remove the interface from the corresponding S-VLANs. Use the no switchport vlan-mapping tunnel command to delete tunneling for all C-VLANs and remove the interface from the corresponding S-VLANs.",
